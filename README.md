# hardware-blacklist

Various types of hardware that was keeping up with the production of other nodes and is no longer able to keep up is listed below. 

Note that all CPU's listed are no longer keeping up in single CPU motherboards. However AMD EPYC CPU's will work in Dual CPU motherboards nicely for the most part as even dual EPYC 7302's with a total of 32 cores  were working last year. However a minumum of 24 core EPYC CPU's is now recommended for Testnet. Possibly more are needed in Mainnet soon. This is only a prediction and cannot be tested or accurately forecast.
    
NO LONGER WORKING IN SINGLE CPU
    
    AMD CPU'S SLOWER THAN RYZEN 3700X (WILL NO LONGER WORK)
    AMD 3700X
    AMD 3900X (MARGINAL AS IT MAY BARELY WORK NOW)
